# Setting Up Account and Logging into the Server

1. To register with Compute Canada (CC), you need a valid **CCRI**.
2. Once the CCRI is received, register here: [https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/)
3. Create your **username and password**.
4. The system requires you to set up **multi-factor authentication** at this link:  
   [https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/multi_factor_authentications](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/multi_factor_authentications)
5. Once you have your username and password, log into one of the CC servers (e.g., **B√©luga**) using SSH:

   ```bash
   ssh <username>@beluga.alliancecan.ca
   ```

   The system will prompt you for a password and a login approval via **Duo Push** on your phone.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The **username is not your CCI**!  
> It is the name of the account, and you can find it on the CCDB **Home** page.

## Storage Directories on Login

Once logged in, you will see three directories:

- `nearline/`
- `projects/`
- `scratch/`

### Purpose of Each Directory

| Feature   | `projects/`            | `scratch/`               | `nearline/`               |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Use Case  | Long-term, shared      | Temporary, fast I/O       | Cold archive               |
| Backup    | Sometimes              | ‚ùå No                     | ‚ùå No                      |
| Retention | Persistent             | Purged after 30‚Äì60 days   | Persistent                 |
| Speed     | Medium-Fast            | ‚ö° Very fast               | üê¢ Slow                    |
| Quota     | PI-based               | Per-user, large           | Per-user, very large       |

## üß¨ Best Practice Example for RNA-seq

- Store **raw FASTQ files** in `nearline/`
- Copy FASTQs to `scratch/` for alignment
- Store final **BAMs, counts, and scripts** in `projects/`
